Section 2: Your Opinion on Both Approaches

Explanation:
There are two types of programming assignment approach used in this experiment:

- Scaffolded Approach: The problem is decomposed into several sub-problems. You need to solve each step before moving on. Each step is provided with intermediate feedback. This approach focuses on guiding you through the problem in a step-by-step manner.

- Traditional/Whole-Problem Approach: The entire problem is presented at once. You need to write a complete solution without intermediate feedback. You receive feedback only after submitting your full solution.

Imagine that you need to solve a complex programming assignment in the future. Please consider both approaches when answering the following questions. 

6. Which approach do you think helps you learn programming more effectively? (single choice)
- Scaffolded
- Whole-Problem
- No preference

7. Which approach do you think better supports your problem-solving or guide way of thinking process? (single choice)
- Scaffolded
- Whole-Problem
- No preference

8. Which approach do you prefer for future assignments? (single choice)
- Scaffolded
- Whole-Problem
- Depends on the task
- No preference

9. Do you have any concerns or expectations for Scaffolded/Whole-Problem approach? (open ended)
