Cool! You are able to print the value of n as string as much as n times.

Task:
Modify the print_number_triangle(n) so it can accept an integer n as input and prints the value of 1 to n as a string.

Example:
If n = 3, the output should be:
"1"
"2"
"3"

Hint:
1. You can use the built-in str() function to convert a number to a string.
2. You can use a for loop to solve this exercise.
