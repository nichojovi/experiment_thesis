Task: 
Write a function print_number_triangle(n) that prints a triangle of numbers from 1 to n.

Example:
If n = 3, the output should be:
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 

Hint: 
1. You can use the built-in str() function to convert numbers to strings.
2. Each number should be followed by a space, including the last number.
3. You need more than one for loop here (nested loop).
4. Consider using a temporary variable to store your result (e.g. row = '').
