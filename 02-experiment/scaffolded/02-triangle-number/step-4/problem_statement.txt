Great! Let's start something more challenging now.

Task:
Modify the print_number_triangle(n) function so that it accepts an integer n as input and prints the sequence of numbers from 1 to n, each converted to a string and separated by a space.

Example:
If n = 3, the output should be:
"1 2 3 "

Hints:
1. You can use the built-in str() function to convert numbers to strings.
2. Each number should be followed by a space, including the last number.
3. You can use a for loop to solve this exercise.
4. Consider using a temporary variable to store your result (e.g. row = '').
