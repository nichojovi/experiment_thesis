Well done on printing the number sequence on a single line! Now, let's take it a step further. 

Task:
Modify your print_number_triangle(n) function so that it prints the same number sequence from 1 to n (each followed by a space). 
But this time, repeat the same line n times, with each sequence printed on a new line.

Example:
If n = 3, the output should be:
"1 2 3 "
"1 2 3 "
"1 2 3 "

Hints:
1. You can use the built-in str() function to convert numbers to strings.
2. Each number should be followed by a space, including the last number.
3. You need more than one for loop here. 
4. Consider using temporary variable to store your result (e.g. row = '').
