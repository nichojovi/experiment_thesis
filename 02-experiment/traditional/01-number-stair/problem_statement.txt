Task:
Write a function called print_number_staircase(start, step, n) that print a sequence number of the vertical staircase using the formula:
staircase = start + step * i

Example:
If start = 2, step = 3, and n = 5, the output should be:
2
5
8
11
14

Hint: 
- Pay attention to the formula.
- Don't forget to print the result using print().
- You can use a for loop with range(n).
