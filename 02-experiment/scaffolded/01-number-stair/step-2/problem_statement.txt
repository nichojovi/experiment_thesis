Good job! You manage to write the formula correctly!

Task:
Now, modify the print_number_stair(start, step, n) function so it can print the value of a single staircase n times using this formula:
staircase = start + step * n

Where:
- start is the first number (1 <= start <= 10),
- step is the fixed difference between numbers (1 <= step <= 10),
- n is the number of steps (1 <= n <= 10).

Example:
If start = 2, step = 3, and n = 5, the output should be:
17
17
17
17
17

Hint: 
- You can use a for loop with range(n).
