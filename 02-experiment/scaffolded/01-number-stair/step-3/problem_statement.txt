Great! Now, lets modify the formula a bit.

Task:
Modify the print_number_stair(start, step, n) function so it can print a sequence number of the vertical staircase using the formula:
staircase = start + step * i

Where:
- start is the first number (1 <= start <= 10),
- step is the fixed difference between numbers (1 <= step <= 10),
- i is the step starting from 0 to n-1 (1 <= n <= 10).

Example:
If start = 2, step = 3, and n = 5, the output should be:
2
5
8
11
14

Hint: 
- You can use a for loop with range(n).
