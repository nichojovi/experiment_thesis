Python Cheat Sheet - Functions, Loops, and Range

1. Function and Parameter

# Define a function with a parameter
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}")

# Call the function with an argument
greet("Alice")


2. Casting with str()

# Convert integer to string
x = 10
s = str(x)  # s is now "10" (a string)


3. Printing Values

# Print a number
print(1)

# Print a string
print("test")

# Print using formatted string (f-string)
i = 2
j = 5
print(f"{i}{j}")  # Output: "25"


4. Single Loop

# Loop from 0 to 2
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

The code above will print: 
0
1 
2 
3


5. Double (Nested) Loop

# Loop through pairs of i and j
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(3):
        print(f"{i}{j}", end=' ')

The code above will print: 00 01 02 10 11 12


6. The range() in Loop Examples

Start from 0 to n, n=5
range(5)         
The code above will iterate: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

Start from 1 to n-1, n=5
range(1, 5) 
The code above will iterate: 1, 2, 3, 4

Start from 2 to 10, and increment by 2 
range(2, 10, 2)  
The code above will iterate: 2, 4, 6, 8 (The 10 is not included)

Start from 9 to 3, and decrement by 3 
range(9, 3, -3)  
The code above will iterate: 9, 6 (The 3 is not included)
