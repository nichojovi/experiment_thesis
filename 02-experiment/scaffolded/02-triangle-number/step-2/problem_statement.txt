Cool! You able to cast an integer value to string.

Task:
Now, modify the print_number_triangle(n) so it can accept an integer n as input and prints the value of n as a string, n times.

Example:
If n = 3, the output should be:
"3"
"3"
"3"

Hint:
1. You can use the built-in str() function to convert a number to a string.
2. You can use for loop to solve this exercise.
