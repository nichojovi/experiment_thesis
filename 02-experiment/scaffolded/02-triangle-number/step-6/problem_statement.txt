Awesome progress so far! You've printed a row of numbers and repeated it, now let's shape that into a triangle.

Task:
Modify your print_number_triangle(n) so it will print a triangle of numbers from 1 to n.

Example:
If n = 3, the output should be:
"1 "
"1 2 "
"1 2 3 "

Hint: 
1. You can use the built-in str() function to convert numbers to strings.
2. Each number should be followed by a space, including the last number.
3. You need more than one for loop here (nested loop).
4. Consider using a temporary variable to store your result (e.g. row = '').
